# Failed Banks in the US
 US Banking Data Highlights the Failed Banks over the Last Two Decades. This project relies on data from the World Bank and America's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The goal was to map the state of the economy to the bank failures in each year between 2000 and 2020.
